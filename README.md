# Horiseon Maketing Agency : Code Refactor Project

## Overview
This is a project carried out to refactor the given codebase of Horiseon marketing agency. Through refactoring the code, it was expected to improve the accessibility features and efficiency of the given code.

## Important Links
Refer to the following links:
* [Horiseon - Deployed page](https://vish-opatha.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor/)

* [Horiseon - Github repository](https://github.com/vish-opatha/horiseon-code-refactor/)

## Technical Acceptance - Work Done
1. Introduced semantic HTML tags (header,main,figure,section, aside and footer) which were not in the given code.
2. Organized html elements in the following order.
3. Inserted alt attributes to improve the accessibility for images.
4. Changed the heading attribute in the footer section from h2 to h3 because I belive that line is not as important as other headings in the page. Now the headers fall in the sequential order from h1, h2 to h3.
5. First link in the navigation bar did not work. I fixed that.
6. Depending on the code there were several repeating CSS selectors in the "content" and "benifits", I wrote them in a way that those selectors will apply to tags, rather than repeating classes. 
7. Application's CSS file is commented to improve readability and follows the semantic structure of HTML.

## Deployment - Work Done
1. Application is deployed at live URL using Github pages, and the link is in the important links section.
2. No errors found in loading.
3. Link to the Github URL is given and the repository contains the improved code.

## Application Quality - Work Done
1. Deployed page resembls the moke-up.

## Repository Quality - Work Done
1. Repository is named as horiseon-code-refactor.
2. Regarding the folder structure, "Assests" includes seperate folders for CSS and images.
3. In the HTML, I have changed the class name of the cover image to "cover-image" from "hero".
4. Tags are indented accordingly and comments are included.
5. Changes were committed multiple times with messages.
